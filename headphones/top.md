# Top 10 Headphones

1. **Sennheiser HD 650** — The reference open-back. Warm, natural, endlessly comfortable. Hard to beat for the price.

2. **Sony WH-1000XM5** — Best all-around ANC wireless. Light, folds flat, sounds great on a plane.

3. **Apple AirPods Max** — Premium build, spatial audio is legit. Heavy but worth it if you're in the Apple ecosystem.

4. **Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro** — Closed-back studio workhorse. Punchy bass, great isolation, built like a tank.

5. **Hifiman Sundara** — Planar magnetic at a reasonable price. Detail and staging that punch way above their weight.

6. **Audio-Technica ATH-M50x** — The classic portable studio monitor. Foldable, reliable, slightly V-shaped fun.

7. **Bose QuietComfort Ultra** — Comfort king with excellent ANC. Slightly warmer than Sony, better for long wear.

8. **AKG K712 Pro** — Wide soundstage, airy and open. Great for gaming and mixing if you want space.

9. **Moondrop Void** — Planar open-back at budget price. Surprisingly resolving, light, and easy to drive.

10. **Focal Bathys** — Wireless hi-fi that actually sounds hi-fi. ANC plus wired DAC mode for the best of both worlds.
